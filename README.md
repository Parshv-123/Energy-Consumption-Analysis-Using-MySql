🌍 Energy Consumption Analysis (SQL Project)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global energy consumption, production, GDP, population, and emissions using SQL.
It aims to uncover insights into how energy demand, economic growth, and population affect emissions, and highlights the importance of clean energy adoption.

The project uses relational database design with multiple datasets linked via a Country table, and SQL queries to answer real-world energy and sustainability questions.

🗂️ Database Design

Country – master table with unique country codes.

Population – yearly population data per country.

GDP – yearly GDP values.

Production – energy production by type and year.

Consumption – energy consumption by type and year.

Emissions – energy type, emissions, and per-capita values.

🔗 The Country table connects all datasets.
📊 ERD shows one-to-many relationships between Country and other entities.

⚡ Key SQL Queries & Insights
1️⃣ Total Emissions by Country (Latest Year)

China, USA, and India are the top emitters.

Major focus areas for reducing global emissions.

2️⃣ Top 5 Countries by GDP (Latest Year)

Highlights the world’s largest economies.

Useful for comparing economic vs. environmental impact.

3️⃣ Production vs. Consumption (Country & Year)

USA, China → higher production than consumption (surplus/exporters).

India, Japan → higher consumption than production (import dependency).

4️⃣ Energy Types & Emissions Contribution

Coal & Oil dominate emissions.

Renewables (solar, wind, hydro) show minimal emissions → sustainability advantage.

5️⃣ Trends Over Time

Emissions: Increasing globally with GDP & population.

GDP: Consistent growth in developed nations, rapid rise in emerging economies.

Population Impact: Larger populations (China, India) = higher emissions.

📈 Conclusion

🌍 Energy demand rises with population & GDP growth.

⚠️ Fossil fuels dominate, keeping emissions high.

🇨🇳🇺🇸🇮🇳 China, USA, and India = largest contributors.

📉 Some nations show efficiency improvements.

✅ Future depends on clean energy & sustainable policies.

🌱 Recommendations for Sustainability

✔ Switch to renewables (solar, wind, hydro).
✔ Boost energy efficiency in industry & transport.
✔ Target top emitters (China, USA, India) for maximum impact.
✔ Improve carbon efficiency (more GDP per unit of emission).
✔ Cut per-capita emissions in energy-intensive economies.
✔ Adopt strong climate policies (carbon tax, subsidies, green tech).
